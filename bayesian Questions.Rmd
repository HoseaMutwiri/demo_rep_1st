1. In a small survey, a random sample of 50 people from a large population is selected. 
Each person is asked a question to which the answer is either Yes" or No." Let the 
proportion in the population who would answer Yes" be 𝜃. Our prior distribution 
for 𝜃 is a 𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎(1.5, 1.5) distribution. In the survey, 37 people answer “Yes.". 
Use R to:
i) Find prior probability that 𝜃 < 0.6 equals 0.62647.
```{r}
library(LearnBayes)
library(HDInterval)

pbeta(0.6,1.5,1.5)#PRIOR PROBABILITY
```
ii) Plot a graph showing the prior and posterior probability density functions of 𝜃
on the same axes.
```{r}
#plotting a graph showing the prior and posterior probability
theta<-seq(0.01,0.99,0.01)
prior0<-dbeta(theta,1.5,1.5)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
data<-c(37,13)
posterior<-dbeta(theta,37,13)
plot(theta,posterior,ylab="density")
triplot(prior0,data,where="topright")
```
2. The numbers of sales of a particular item from an Internet retail site in each of 20 
weeks are recorded. Assume that, given the value of a parameter 𝜆, these numbers 
are independent observations from the Poisson (𝜆) distribution. Our prior 
distribution for 𝜆 is a gamma (a, b) distribution. Suppose prior mean and standard 
deviation for 𝜆 are 16 and 8 respectively. The observed numbers of sales are as 
follows.
14, 19, 14, 21, 22, 33, 15, 13, 16, 19, 27, 22, 27, 21, 16, 25, 14, 23, 22, 17

```{r}
#plotting both prior and posterior probability density function
sales<-c(14,19,14,21,22,33,15,13,16,19,27,
         22,27,16,25,14,23,22,17)
lambda<-seq(10,25,0.05)
prior<-dgamma(lambda,4,0.25)
post<-dgamma(lambda,404,20.25)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(lambda,post,xlab="expression(lambda)",ylab="Density")
triplot(prior,post,where="topright")
```

find a 95% posterior HPD interval for 𝜆.
```{r}
hdi(dgamma(0.95,404,20.25))#posterior HPD interval
```

3. If we observe 𝑛 independent occurrences 𝑥1
, 𝑥2
, … , 𝑥𝑛 from a Poisson distribution 
with rate 𝜃 and assume that the prior distribution for 𝜃 is Gamma with parameter 𝛼
and 𝛽, the resulting distribution is Gamma with parameters ( 𝑥𝑖 + 𝛼, 𝑛 + 𝛽). 
Suppose the prior parameters are 2,5) and 𝑥𝑖 = 8 while 𝑛 = 10. 
Write an R- code for plotting the posterior and prior distributions on the same axis 
taking the range of 𝜃 to be 0 ≤ 𝜃 ≤ 2. 

```{r}
#plotting posterior and prior on the same axis
theta1<-seq(0,2,0.001)
y<-dgamma(theta1,2,5)
plot(theta1,ylim=range(0:3),ylab="",xlab="theta")
legend(0,2.5,"prior")
legend(0.6,2.8,"posterior")
curve(dbinom(2,8,x))#plotting likelihood function
```
4. Suppose that the proportion 𝜃 of defective items in a large manufactured lot is 
known to be either 0.1 or 0.2, and the prior probability of θ is as follow 
 𝜋(0.1) = 0.7 and 𝜋 (0.2) = 0.3.
Suppose also that when eight items are selected at random from the lot, it is found 
that exactly two of them are defective. State the appropriate package that should be 
loaded, write R-codes to plot the following and show the output;
```{r}
#plotting likelihood function
x<-seq(0,1,by=0.001)
plot(x,dbeta(x,1,1),ylab="",main="Beta (1,1) prior")
```
ii) uniform prior distribution named prior1 
```{r}
#plotting uniform prior distribution
prior1=c(1,1)
data1=c(2,6)
triplot(prior1,data1,where="topright")
```
#plotting the data model prior1 and corresponding posterior
plot(x,dbeta(x,2,3),ylab="",main="(Beta(2,3)prior")
```{r}
#plotting conjugate beta prior
prior2=c(2,3)
data=c(2,6)
triplot(prior2,data,where="topright")
```
iv) conjugate beta prior with parameters 2 and 3 named prior2 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(x,dbeta(x,1,1),ylab="",main="Beta(1,1)prior")
plot(x,dbeta(x,2,3),ylab="",main="(Beta(2,3)prior")
```

v) data model, prior2 and corresponding posterior on the same device
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(x,dbeta(x,2,3),ylab="",main="(Beta(2,3)prior")
triplot(prior2,data,where="topright")

```
vi) plots ii), iii), iv) and v) on the same graphic displayed in two rows and two 
columns and follows row wise order
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(x,dbeta(x,1,1),ylab="",main="Beta(1,1)prior")
plot(x,dbeta(x,2,3),ylab="",main="(Beta(2,3)prior")
triplot(prior1,data1,where="topright")
triplot(prior2,data,where="topright")
```
